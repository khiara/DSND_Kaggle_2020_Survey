## 1. Installation
There should be no need to install any libraries to run the analysis and visualizations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, version 3.*. 

## 2. Project Motivation
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. As someone who aspires to a data science career, I was interested in finding out how established data science professionals acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed at their jobs. Specifically, the questions I looked to answer were:
  1. Do you need a formal degree?
  2. What programming language(s) do you need to know?
  3. What are the preferred online learning platforms for acquiring skills and knowledge?
